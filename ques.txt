Q1. Please do the below assignment and submit the GitHub link containing the code and a 1-2 minute 
Loom video link of you talking about you and the assignment. 
Talk about your thought process while doing the assignment, how you went about it, 
why did you do the coding in a certain way and what can be improved. 
The expected time to code is 4-6 hours.

Assignment: Implement a REST API in Python/Flask which will take a given PDF file, angle of rotation, page number. 
The API should rotate the specified page in the given angle and replace that page back into the PDF. 
The PDF file can be an image PDF or true PDF (meaning it can be any type of PDF). 
You can use either a GET or POST, up to you to decide - you can briefly talk about the reasoning. 
The number of pages in the PDF will remain the same after this process.

API inputs:
    file_path :
    angle_of_rotation: Multiple of 90 degrees (90/180/270)
    page_number: 1 to n (n is the number of pages in the pdf file)

API Output:
    PDF file path with rotated pages.

Only the specified page mentioned in the input should be rotated, the rest of the pages stays the same. 
Sample inputs you will have to use and submit the output:
file_path: /tmp/test.pdf
angle_of_rotation: 90
page_number: 3

Things to submit:
1. GitHub link containing the code
2. 1-2 minute Loom video link of you talking about you and the assignment
3. Converted PDF link (upload to any cloud drive and provide the link)
